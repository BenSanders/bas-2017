# Hi, I'm Ben

I’m a web developer living in Georgia now with an associate’s degree in web
design and development.

I love technology whether it is from Microsoft, Apple or where ever. I am a
YouTuber trying to find his voice. I hope to one day start a tech startup to
solve some problem that humanity has and maybe use YouTube as a launch pad for
it.

I don't blog here very often but I'm hoping to change that in 2017. Some of the
things I plan to blog about are some of the same things I plan on vlogging about.
I plan on making product reviews of new tech that comes out and maybe a few
gameplay videos thrown in the mix.

If you'd like to keep quicker contact with me just follow my twitter.
